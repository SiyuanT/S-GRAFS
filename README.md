This is a demo script for the Satellite derived global root-zone soil moisture assimilation and forecast system. 
The forcing data are GPM rainfall and air temperature anomalies.
The assimilated data is the satellite soil moisture data
The model for surface soil moisture is a simple API model and the root-zone soil moisture is derived from an exponential filter
